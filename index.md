**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is Expectation Maximization for Principal Component Analysis (EM for PCA).

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is how visual stimulation affects different animals' brain activity (spikes in neural activity).

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I'd make to the approach taken in my Quarter 1 project is to focus more on practicality, instead of mainly focusing on the theoretics of the problem. It would be more useful to put the ideas into practice while we learn about them.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
A technique I would be interested in using is Bayesian Principal Component Analysis
